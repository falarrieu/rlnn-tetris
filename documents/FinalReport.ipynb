    "We both really enjoy Tetris and we are interested in applying reinforcement learning to a more complex problem than we've seen in class. Applying it to tetris will be constantly interesting, and the research we've done shows it also will not be trivial. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we sought to create an AI to play Tetris. It would use a neural network and reinforcement learning to learn to play tetris optimally. To do so, would require us to either find an implementation of Tetris or implement the game ourselves, then define our states and actions to be used by the Q-net. We ended up just implementing the parts of the game logic that we needed to train the network we created.\n",

The first subproblem is determining the best placement for a piece, while the second subproblem involves moving the piece into the desired position and rotation. If time permits, we may also incorporate a piece selection strategy. We planned to use two reinforced neural networks, each responsible for one subproblem, and deploy them in an ensemble model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the model will input a still frame of the game. If a piece is being held, both the held piece and the current piece will be run through the position neural network, and the position with the better placement will be output. If no piece is being held, then the next piece and the current piece will be run through the position neural network, and again the position with the better placement will be output. The best position will then be fed into the movement neural network, which will determine the next best action to take to move towards that position."

    "### Process\n",
    "We began by adapting code from the lecture notes on reinforcement learning to build the movement neural network architecture. Building the optimizer and neural network classes was as simple as a copy-paste, with some small changes for our use case. The next step was to write our `initial_state`, `next_state`, `reinforcement`, `epsilon_greedy`, and `make_samples` functions to support reinforcement learning. We chose to have each sample be a single movement of the Tetris piece, meaning one action would be chosen. Each trial would be one piece moving from the top of the board to a locking position at the bottom, so each trial would have at most 20 samples because the board is 20 pixels tall. This naturally lead to us defining the initial state to be a new piece placed in the top center of the board and next state being the current piece moved however the epsilon greedy policy chooses. We defined our epsilon greedy policy similarly to how it was done for the marble example in lecture, where it would either randomly pick an action or choose the best action according to the neural network. We improved it by restricting the possible actions that could be chosen based on whether the move would be valid. For example, if any squares on the piece are touching the right wall of the board, the piece should not be able to move to the right. With all of the logic defined, we could then define our reinforcement policy as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the piece gets closer to its goal in the x direction, increment reinforcement by 1. Otherwise decrement by 1.\n",
    "2. If the piece gets closer to its goal in the y direction, increment reinforcement by 1. Otherwise decrement by 1.\n",
    "3. If the piece gets closer to the correct rotation, increment reinforcement by 1. Otherwise decrement by 1.\n",
    "4. If the piece reaches its goal exactly, increment reinforcement by 20.\n",
    "5. The total of all of these increments and decrements is the reinforcement for the current action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing the reinforcements meant we were done defining our policy. As a part of this process we also wrote multiple classes for controlling the game logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A board class to store the board state and provide logic for moving pieces within the board\n",
    "* A Game class for controlling next piece choice and game rules\n",
    "* A class for each shape of piece that all inherit from a Tetromino class for defining individual piece types\n",
    "\n",
    "We then started training the model, with very little success. No matter how much we trained, our loss would not decrease over the training time. We would get decreases in loss for each set of samples, but it would not improve overall. To try to find improvement, we started by reducing the state space. We stopped the pieces from locking in place, which meant that a piece would always be trying to reach a position at the bottom of the board. Next, we tried using only one type of piece for training, and then always having the same goal. Our final attempt was giving the piece multiple tries per trial to reach the goal to see if having more samples in one trial would allow for better training. Much to our dismay, none of this made any difference in our accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "After failing to fix our current implementation, we pivoted to using a Deep Q Learning network implemented with pytorch, which we adapted from [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html). It was a joy working with pytorch for this implementation, and we learned a lot about techniques for reinforcement learning that weren't touched on in lecture. To begin, we generalized their DQN module to allow us to pass an architecture for the fully connected layers on construction. One big difference between this implementation and our original one is that the training for the DQN happens outside of the neural network class. It was difficult to change the way we were thinking about our code. Once we got the code working, this instantly improved our results. The agent would actually learn to move the pieces, and with enough training we were able to get very high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe there was some problem with the way we adapted the network from the lecture notes that was causing our bad results. However, the DQN had some other optimizations that seemed to contribute to our success. The DQN includes a replay memory, which means the network doesn't forget samples from previous trials, allowing it to continue learning from older attempts. The replay memory has a set size, which means it will begin to forget trials as they become too old, so it's always improving. It also uses a policy network and a target network. The idea behind the target network is to decouple the Q-value estimates from the network  being updated, which helps to stabilize training the network."

Each of the composed components are then transposed into batch tensors. With these tensors we can then compute the Q values of the state and actions within our transitions. We then compute the loss, minimize the loss using the chosen optimizer (Adam or SGD), and update the parameters of the neural network.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In working on this project, we gained valuable knowledge and further solidified our understanding of machine learning techniques. During the inception phase, we quickly reviewed various implementations of the Tetris problem, which allowed us to observe the flexibility of problem-solving in machine learning. Each paper had similar but different approaches to tackling the Tetris problem, giving us the ability to be more creative in composing our solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis was that decomposing the Tetris problem into subproblems would enable us to assign responsibility to different agents, each finely tuned to handle one problem. However, when implementing the agent responsible for moving the tetrominoes (MovementNN), we initially encountered issues with the agent not learning patterns, even though there were no obvious errors in implementation. We suspected the large game state space of Tetris might be causing the problem, but after testing the agent through 100,000s of trials, we found no improvement.\n",
    "With the due date fast approaching, we decided to proceed with using the Deep Q Learning methodology. We re-implemented the neural network, incorporated replay memory, and added a separate trainer implementation. Our efforts yielded positive results with near 50% accuracy in testing, without hyperparameter optimization and under 1000 episodes. After, we began to conduct hyperparameter optimization as well as increasing the number of episodes. **Results**\n",
