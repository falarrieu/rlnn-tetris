However, others have created Tetris AIs before and achieved much higher results, so it is very possible we could do the same.\n",

More lines cleared at once means more points, but it may depend on whether we incentivize survival or score more, because often clearing single lines over and over could be an easier way to survive. However, it should still be possible to get a high score. Our goal will be 999,999.\n",
